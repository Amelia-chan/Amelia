#

An open-source, forever-free Discord bot written in Kotlin-Java with Javacord and Nexus designed for ScribbleHub RSS feeds. Amelia offers an alternative to the likes of MonitoRSS in handling ScribbleHub RSS feeds with complete support of both author feeds and story feeds in ScribbleHub.

## üí≠ Luminous Amelia?

Luminous Amelia is the second major iteration of Amelia which takes notes and lessons from her sisters, Mana and Bellus, to provide a more optimized, cleaner and stable experience compared to her previous iterations. Unlike her previous iterations, she has more functions removed (e.g. the trending feature, custom formats, etc.) to make way for simplicity.

### üñ±Ô∏è Self-Hosting

You can set up Amelia's client by running the simple command below.

> **Warning**
>
> This assumes that you have Docker installed otherwise please install Docker first.
> Also assuming that you have her websocket client installed.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ManaNet/Amelia && cd Amelia && docker build -t amelia .
```

Please configure the `.env` file before continuing, here is a shortcut command to creating the .env file:
```shell
cp .env.example .env && nano .env
```

Afterwards, you can run the following command:
```shell
docker run --name amelia-client --env-file .env amelia:latest
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Websocket Installation
Amelia Websocket, which is a new addition implemented on Amelia 2.0, is a separate process of Amelia which can be said as the heart or the brain
of the Discord bot. The websocket handles the checking for updates on RSS Feeds and also Trending Notifications.

To install the websocket, you need to download the websocket jar from the [weboscket repository's releases page](https://github.com/ManaNet/Amelia-Websocket/releases) and then setup the following environment variables:
```
amelia_auth=AUTHENTICATION
amelia_db=mongodb://user:pass@ip:port
(OPTIONAL) amelia_websocket=ws://ip:3201/
```

After the environment variables are set, you can now start up the websocket with no configuration via: `java -jar Amelia-Websocket.jar`
